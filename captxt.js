const captxt = {
	"Timor-Leste": "Timor Leste (also known as East Timor) gained independence in 1999 and became a soverign nation in 2002, voting for their first parliament in 2001. Much of their increase in Voice & Accountability came over that transition period.",
	"Kosovo": "Following the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, when the Indices were initially calculated, Kosovo (as part of Serbia) was given a very low score since there was no elected government in the country. With its first parliamentary elections in 2001, the Voice & Accountability score increased drastically. Uncertainty for Kosovo's score early in the survey, however, is very high since it was not an independent nation at the time.",
	"Liberia": "Much of the Liberian uptick in Voice & Accountability came with the first parliamentary elections in 2005 following a 2003 peace treaty to end the Liberian Civil Wars.",
	"Thailand": "A 2006 coup d'etat in Thailand is responsible for much of the decline in Voice & Accountability, followed by another subsequent coup in 2014. As for Political Stability & Threat of Violence/Terrorism, a single event has determined the substantial drop in Thailand's ranking, the beginning of the South Thailand insurgency in 2004. Unlike in Mali, however, this insurgency is ongoing and there have been several high profile incidents over the last 15 years.",
	"Cayman Islands": "Being a British Overseas Territory, governance is fairly limited, reflected in the wide uncertainty in the score on this index. However, Hurricane Ivan in 2004 decimated the islands, disrupting much of its infrastructure, and this appears to have had a sizable impact on their Voice & Accountability.",
	"Venezuela": "Venezuela's score has been on a steady decline throughout the survey, suggesting that perception of the Bolivarian Revolution is that it has been generally bad for Voice and Accountability in the country. This is reinforced by the multiple times Venezuelans have tried to overthrow the Chavez and Maduro governments. Its decline in Regulatory Quality came early on in the survey period and has essentially bottomed out since the Bolivarian Revolution, near the 0th percentile.",
	"Rwanda": "Making the top 3 in 5 different categories of governance, Rwanda has gone from near the bottom to near the middle in percentile due to its recovery following a bloody Civil War in the 1990s. The only category in which it has not seen a drastic improvement is Voice & Accountability, as the post-war government consists primarily of one party (Rwandan Patriotic Front) and most opposition is suppressed.",
	"Sierra Leone": "Like Rwanda, Sierra Leone has seen a substantial increase in Political Stability & Absence of Violence since the conclusion of a Civil War in the early-2000s.",
	"Mali": "Mali has seen a dramatic decline in its Political Stability & Absence of Violence score with the 2012 Tuareg rebellion. Its ranking has not recovered despite relative stability following the defeat of the rebels in 2013 by a joint Malian and French force.",
	"Tunisia": "The primary decline in Tunisia's ranking is due to the 2011 Tunisian Revolution, which featured civil unrest and violence. However, despite increased stability, there remains occasional terrorism in the country, keeping its score down.",
	"Serbia": "As with the increase in Voice & Accountability in Kosovo (which was mirrored in Serbia), the increase in Government Effectiveness is due to recovery from the Yugoslav wars which were still ongoing at the beginning of the survey period. Similar top 3 increases were seen in Rule of Law and Control of Corruption for the same time period.",
	"Georgia": "Georgia has seen drastic increase in Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. Following the Rose Revolution in 2003, many of the indices began rising, some dramatically, as the country began taking a more pro-Western approach. Georgia's all-index average percentile went from 17 in 1996 to 64 in 2017, with its primary weakness remaining Political Stability & Absence of Violence/Terrorism given the potential for ongoing conflict with separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.",
	"Maldives": "Maldives has seen a steady decline in its Government Effectiveness ranking since the beginning of the survey, albeit associated with increased uncertainty over its rating. The country suffered a great deal of damage in the 2004 tsunami, and its government has been relatively unstable ever since. However, there is no one incident that can be pointed to in causing the decline.",
	"Belize": "Like the Maldives, Belize has seen a steady decline in Government Effectiveness since the index's inception. Their ranking has fluctuated somewhat and is perhaps impacted by frequent major hurricanes.",
	"Puerto Rico": "Half of the drop for Puerto Rico has come between the 2016 and 2017 surveys, likely a combined impact of the debt crisis in early-2017 and impact of Hurricane Maria later that year.",
	"West Bank and Gaza": "Much of the increase in the West Bank & Gaza in Regulatory Quality came between the 2008 and 2009 surveys, which is shortly after the 2007 takeover of Gaza by Hamas, which began the Israeli blockade. This single jump is beyond the range of significance (cannot be explained by the 90th percentile uncertainty range), which makes for quite an impressive break.",
	"Bolivia": "Much of the drop in Regulatory Quality in Bolivia came from 2004 to 2005 with the resignation of Carlos Mesa and the election of Evo Morales later that year. This may have been perceived as a negative from a private sector perspective.",
	"Nauru": "From the 2013 to 2014 surveys, Nauru's Rule of Law index dropped by over 50 percentile points. This is likely related to the reopening of the Nauru Regional Processing Centre which houses asylum-seekers to Australia and at the time subjected detainees in harsh conditions. This decline, however, is within the margins of uncertainty for this index.",
	"Eritrea": "Eritrea has seen a constant decline in its Control of Corruption index since its inception. No one event can be pointed to as the cause of this, although it is likely that the lack of democratic elections and suppression of independent press has contributed to this decline in the Control of Corruption index.",
	"Zimbabwe": "Much of Zimbabwe's decline occurred during the first iterations of the index, as it was initially given a Control of Corruption index in the 40th percentile which quickly decline to near 0. This is in many ways a result of the policies of Robert Mugabe's government, because of which the country's economy collapsed in the early-2000s.",
	"Trinidad and Tobago": "A number of factors may play a role in the decline of Trinidad & Tobago's Control of Corruption index, including increased dependency on petrochemicals to finance the country (although that has helped to develop the country into one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean) and its role as a conduit for illegal narcotics out of South America."
